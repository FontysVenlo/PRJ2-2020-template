# PRJ2 2020 
Project 2 - 2020 

The purpose of this repository is to document your Project work. 

***Your group is responsible for the repository structure and content***, but we created some template folders for you. You do not need to stick to this. 

Currently the structure is as follows:
* [Project Management](/project-management) - Put all project management related stuff in here, e.g. meetings outcomes, retrospectives, screenshots, minutes, planning. 
* [Analysis](/analysis) - this is the folder where you should put all analysis artefacts into
* [Design](/design) - this is the folder where you should put all analysis artefacts into
* [Implementation](/implementation) - this is the folder where you should put all analysis artefacts into

***Feel free to adapt the structure***
